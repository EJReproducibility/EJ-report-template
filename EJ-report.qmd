## Metadata Check

### Folder Structure and `ReadMe`

-   [ ] Folder structure is correct, i.e. it looks like

    ```
    ├── 1-paper
    ├── 2-appendices
    ├── 3-replication-package.zip
    └── 4-confidential-data-not-for-publication.zip  (Optional)
    ```

The folder `3-replication-package` contains a `ReadMe` file, which is  adequate and includes **all** of the following items:

-   [ ] It is in PDF format.
-   [ ] Description of the content of the replication package.
-   [ ] Data availability statement (description of the origin of the data and how to obtain access to them)
-   [ ] A Statement about Rights: 
        
    > 1. I certify that the author(s) of the manuscript have legitimate access to and permission to use the data used in this manuscript.
    > 2. I certify that the author(s) of the manuscript have documented permission to redistribute/publish the data contained within this replication package. Appropriate permission are documented in the LICENSE.txt file (if applicable).

-   [ ] Precise instructions on how to run the code
-   [ ] Indications on where to find the output saved/displayed.
-   [ ] Software used (including software version + OS).
-   [ ] All packages and libraries that need to be installed.
-   [ ] Expected running time (even if it is a few seconds).
-   [ ] Data citations.

### Data Citations

Are the data correctly cited:

-   [ ] In the paper.
-   [ ] In the `ReadMe`.
-   [ ] Not applicable (the paper is not empirical).

### Used Datasets

*Check all applicable boxes.*

-   [ ] Empirical with available data.
    -   [ ] All raw datasets are included (main text and appendices, including online), along with the cleaning and analysis codes.
    -   [ ] A copy of all datasets in non-proprietary format (ASCII, csv,etc.) is included.
-   [ ] Empirical with simulated/synthetic data.
    -   [ ] The simulated/synthetic data to produce all tables and figures in the paper is included.
    -   [ ] A copy of all datasets in non-proprietary format (ASCII, csv,etc.) is included.
    -   [ ] A data exemption at the time of first submission was granted (*to be ticked by the Data Editor*).
-   [ ] The paper only includes simulations.
-   [ ] Experimental.
    -   [ ] All raw datasets are included (main text and appendices, including online), along with the cleaning and analysis codes.
    -   [ ] A copy of all datasets in non-proprietary format (ASCII, csv,etc.) is included.

    Also, the following documents are included (if these files are part of the paper or of an appendix, the authors should have copied them again in a separate document included in the replication package): 
    - \[ \] A PDF copy of the IRB approval. 
    - \[ \] A PDF document outlining the design of the experiment, including information on the selection and eligibility of participants. 
    - \[ \] A PDF copy of the instructions given to participants in both original language and an English translation. 
    - \[ \] Raw data collected from the experiment, including a copy in non-proprietary format (ASCII, csv, etc.).


## Reproducibility Checks

Replicator's computational setup:

1. Operating System (e.g. _Windows 10_ or _Mac OS 13.4_ or _nuvolos_):
2. CPU (e.g. _Apple M1 Pro_ or _Intel Core i7_):
3. RAM (e.g. _16 GB_):
4. Software version (e.g. _Stata 16 IC_ or _R 4.2.1_ or _Matlab 2023a_ etc):

## Does the package run through?

-   [ ] Yes.
-   [ ] No.

*If no, please provide comments here.*

## Does it produce the results in the paper?

-   [ ] Yes.
-   [ ] No.

*If no, please provide comments here. Inserting screenshots or textual output from the package next to expected output from the paper is helpful for authors, so please consider including this here.*
